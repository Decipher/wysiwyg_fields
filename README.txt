The Wysiwyg ImageField module is an inline image management tool for the Wysiwyg
module based on the ImageField and Insert modules with an IMCE-esque image
library provided by the FileField Sources and Views modules.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Q. Where did my ImageField go?

A. To make the process of adding inline images as streamlined as possible,
   Wysiwyg ImageField removes the ImageField widget from the user interface,
   making in visible only when needed.

   It is recommended that if you require a ImageField accessible outside of
   the Wysiwyg ImageField experience that you create an ImageField for the sole
   purpose of using it with ImageField instead of using your existing
   ImageField.


Q. How can I add a search to the 'Reference existing files' tab?

A. If you have both the FileField Sources and Views modules installed, the
   'Reference existing files' section will be displayed as a Views table. This
   View can be modified by the administrator (or approved roles) to add or
   remove columns, filters and a number of options.

   By adding an Exposed filter, you are essentially adding a search engine to
   the existing file list.

   The View can be modified at:

Q. How can I see all the files uploaded to the Wysiwyg ImageField widget?

A. Currently this is not available, for the sole purpose of keeping the system
   as simple as possible.

   Ideas have been put forward and there will be a solution for this in a
   future release.
